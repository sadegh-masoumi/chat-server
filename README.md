# Chat-Server 🐍 : A Python-Based Chat Room

This is an advanced Python-based Secure Chat room. The project is entirely based on the Socket Progamming; done using Python. A server is set to the listening mode, with a specific IP Address and Port numner (that can be edited in the script) and clients are made to connect to the server, after which they are promopted to enter a nickname. The messages are then broadcasted to all the clients present. 


## 👉 Usage

1. We will have to start our Server first.
``` shell
Python Server.py
```
<b>Note: </b> Before running the server, make sure to edit the IP address and Port number. By default it is running on Localhost:5555 <br><br>
2. Run the Client file, to start the conversation. 
``` Shell
Python Client.py
```
<br>
3. Now Enter a nickname and start your chatting.
